# dnsAI

**AI-Driven Protection for Authoritative DNS Servers**

`dnsAI` is a Python-based project designed for learning purposes, focused on training AI models to protect **authoritative DNS (authDNS)** servers from potential threats and anomalies.

## 🚀 Overview

The goal of this project is to explore how machine learning and AI can enhance the security of DNS infrastructure by detecting suspicious patterns and improving DNS resilience.

Key objectives:
- Collect and preprocess DNS traffic data
- Train AI/ML models to detect anomalies or attacks
- Evaluate model accuracy and performance
- Simulate protection mechanisms for authDNS

## 🧠 Features

- DNS log parsing and preprocessing
- Anomaly detection using ML models (e.g. Random Forest, Isolation Forest, etc.)
- Customizable training pipelines
- Evaluation metrics and visualizations
- Modular and extendable codebase

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib / seaborn
- joblib
